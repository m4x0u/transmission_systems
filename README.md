# transmission_systems
The objective is to transmit a message from an entry point to an exit point, via a communication channel.
transmission (or communication). The input message is emitted by an input source. The
messages considered in this workshop will be sequences of binary symbols (0 or 1) corresponding
to sampled and quantized information on two logical levels. The output message
will be - as far as possible - similar to the input message. The latter being unable to
cross the propagation channel as it is, it will be adapted to the physical characteristics of the channel by
converting by means of a transducer into a "vector" suitable for transmission, called a signal.
The latter will be injected into the channel by means of a transmitter. At the other end of the channel, it will be
collected and processed by the receiver and the receiving transducer.
The main transmission channels encountered in nature are: the Hertzian channel (free space), the electrically guided channel (cable), the optical guided channel (fiber), the aerial acoustic channel and the underwater acoustic channel. Each propagation channel must be used at a frequency well
particular, the message is transposed around this frequency by the modulation operation. In
Furthermore, the channel will be a source of noise for the signals it carries. The main sources of
noise encountered in practice are: path dispersion, chromatic dispersion, line noise,
detection (shot), thermal noise and amplification noise.
Subsequently, each component of the transmission system between source and destination will be
referred to as transmitter
